## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Layer                  | Technology               |
|:----------------------|:------------------------|
| Backend Framework      | Laravel (PHP 8.3)        |
| Database               | MySQL       |
| Queue System           | MySQL + Laravel Horizon  |
| File Storage           | Local Disk      |
| Reporting Engine       | DOMPDF |
| Job Scheduler          | Laravel Scheduler        |
| Notification Channels  | Email (SMTP / SES)       |

## 📚 Key Components

| Component               | Description                                                  |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Report API**           | RESTful endpoints to manage report generation, status, and downloads |
| **Report Queue**         | Manages asynchronous job processing for report generation |
| **Processing Worker**    | Generates reports and manages storage and delivery |
| **Delivery Manager**     | Delivers reports via email |
| **Audit & History Logs** | Maintains logs for report generation and delivery |

## 📊 Data Flow

```
1. Scheduler triggers weekly job
2. Report API queues report generation jobs
3. Queue Worker processes report jobs
4. Report generated and saved to storage
5. Delivery Manager sends report via email
6. Status updated, audit logs created
```

## 📝 Workflow

1. **Weekly Trigger**
   - Laravel Scheduler runs a command every week.
   
2. **Job Queuing**
   - Queues report generation jobs for each user.
   
3. **Report Generation**
   - Worker processes the job using Laravel DOMPDF.
   - Saves generated reports to storage.
   
4. **Delivery**
   - Sends email with report attached .
   - Updates report status and creates logs.

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

- Secure API authentication (AUTH Middleware)
- Signed, time-limited download URLs --TODO
- Encrypted storage for sensitive reports --TODO
- Auditable history of report generation and downloads

## 📈 Scalability

- Queue and Laravel Horizon for scalable workers
- Horizontal scaling via Docker containers --TODO
- Load-balanced APIs and background workers --TODO

## 📅 Future Enhancements

- Use try/catch block for exception handling
- Real-time job progress updates with WebSockets
- In-app reporting dashboard and analytics
- Multi-format delivery options (Excel, CSV)

## Suggestions for scaling to 100,000+ users
- **Batch & Stagger report jobs** — avoid generating everything at once.
- **Asynchronous Queues** — use Redis + Laravel Horizon, auto-scale workers.
- **Use S3 + CDN** — store reports on S3, deliver via CDN with signed URLs.
- **Optimize Database** — add indexes, cache results, use read replicas.
- **Load Balancing** — scale API servers and workers with Docker + Kubernetes/ECS.
- **Monitor Everything** — use Horizon, CloudWatch/Datadog, and centralized logs.
- **Auto-Scaling** — scale workers and servers based on queue size and traffic.
- **Process Off-Peak** — schedule big jobs during low-traffic hours.
- **Cost Optimization** — use spot/reserved instances, expire old reports.
